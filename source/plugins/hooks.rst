Hooks
-----

GLPI provides a certain amount of "hooks". Their goal is for plugins (mainly) to work on certain places of the framework; like when an item has been added, updated, deleted, ...

This page describes current existing hooks; but not the way they must be implemented from plugins. Please refer to the plugins development documentation.

Standards Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Usage
+++++

Aside from their goals or when/where they're called; you will see three types of different hooks. Some will receive an item as parameter, others an array of parameters, and some won't receive anything. Basically, the way they're declared into your plugin, and the way you'll handle that will differ.

All hooks called are defined in the ``setup.php`` file of your plugin; into the ``$PLUGIN_HOOKS`` array. The first key is the hook name, the second your plugin name; values can be just text (to call a function declared in the ``hook.php`` file), or an array (to call a static method from an object):

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   //call a function
   $PLUGIN_HOOKS['hook_name']['plugin_name'] = 'function_name';
   //call a static method from an object
   $PLUGIN_HOOKS['other_hook']['plugin_name'] = ['ObjectName', 'methodName'];

Without parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Those hooks are called without any parameters; you cannot attach them to any itemtype; basically they'll permit youi to display extra informations. Let's say you want to call the ``display_login`` hook, in you ``setup.php`` you'll add something like:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $PLUGIN_HOOKS['display_login']['myPlugin'] = 'myplugin_display_login';

You will also have to declare the function you want to call in you ``hook.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   /**
     * Display informations on login page
     *
     * @return void
     */
   public function myplugin_display_login () {
      echo "That line will appear on the login page!";
   }

The hooks that are called without parameters are: ``display_central``, ``post_init init_session``, ``change_entity``, ``change_profile```, ``display_login`` and ``add_plugin_where``.

.. _hook_item_parameter:

With item as parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those hooks will send you an item instance as parameter; you'll have to attach them to the itemtypes you want to apply on. Let's say you want to call the ``pre_item_update`` hook for `Computer` and `Phone` item types, in your ``setup.php`` you'll add something like:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   $PLUGIN_HOOKS['pre_item_update']['myPlugin'] = [
      'Computer'  => 'myplugin_updateitem_called',
      'Phone'     => 'myplugin_updateitem_called'
   ];

You will also have to declare the function you want to call in you ``hook.php`` file:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   /**
    * Handle update item hook
    *
    * @param CommonDBTM $item Item instance
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function myplugin_updateitem_called (CommonDBTM $item) {
      //do everything you want!
      //remember that $item is passed by reference (it is an abject)
      //so changes you will do here will be used by the core.
      if ($item::getType() === Computer::getType()) {
         //we're working with a computer
      } elseif ($item::getType() === Phone::getType()) {
         //we're working with a phone
      }
   }

The hooks that are called with item as parameter are: ``item_empty``, ``pre_item_add``, ``post_prepareadd``, ``item_add``, ``pre_item_update``, ``item_update``, ``pre_item_purge``, ``pre_item_delete``, ``item_purge``, ``item_delete``, ``pre_item_restore``, ``item_restore``, ``autoinventory_information``, ``item_add_targets``, ``item_get_events``, ``item_action_targets``, ``item_get_datas``.

With array of parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These hooks will work just as the :ref:`hooks with item as parameter <hook_item_parameter>` expect they will send you an array of parameters instead of only an item instance. The array will contain two entries: ``item`` and ``options``, the first one is the item instance, the second options that have been passed:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   /**
    * Function that handle a hook with array of parameters
    *
    * @param array $params Array of parameters
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function myplugin_params_hook(array $params) {
      print_r($params);
      //Will display:
      //Array
      //(
      //   [item] => Computer Object
      //      (...)
      //
      //   [options] => Array
      //      (
      //            [_target] => /front/computer.form.php
      //            [id] => 1
      //            [withtemplate] => 
      //            [tabnum] => 1
      //            [itemtype] => Computer
      //      )
      //)
   }

The hooks that are called with an array of parameters are: ``post_item_form``, ``pre_item_form``, ``pre_show_item``, ``post_show_item``, ``pre_show_tab``, ``post_show_tab``, ``item_transfer``.

Some hooks will receive a specific array as parameter, they will be detailled below.

Unclassified
++++++++++++

Hooks that cannot be classified in above categories :)

``secured_fields``
   .. versionadded:: 9.4.6

   An array of fields names (with table like ``glpi_mytable.myfield``) that are stored using GLPI crypting methods.
   This allows pluins to add some fields to the ``glpi:security:changekey`` command.

   .. warning::

       Plugins have to ensure crypt migration on their side is OK; and once using it, they **must** properly declare fields.

       All fields that would use the key file without being listed would be unreadable after key has been changed (and stored data would stay potentially unsecure).

``secured_configs``
   .. versionadded:: 9.4.6

   An array of configuration entries that are stored using GLPI crypting methods.
   This allows pluins to add some entries to the ``glpi:security:changekey`` command.

   .. warning::

       Plugins have to ensure crypt migration on their side is OK; and once using it, they **must** properly declare fields.

       All configuration entries that would use the key file without being listed would be unreadable after key has been changed (and stored data would stay potentially unsecure).
